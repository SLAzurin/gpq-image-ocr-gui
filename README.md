# GPU Image OCR GUI

This app works best with my __Maple Culvert Tracker__ Discord bot + server app [here](https://github.com/SLAzurin/maple-culvert-tracker)

Using GPQ Image OCR:
- Download: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki (tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-5.x.x.xxxxxxxx.exe (64 bit)) (Version 5.x) and install to the default `C:` drive path
- Download https://github.com/SLAzurin/gpq-image-ocr-gui/releases/latest (GPQ.Image.OCR.GUI-Windows-x.x.x-Setup.exe) (Latest Version)
- If you are using the Maple Culvert Tracker bot, use `/login` on Discord, login to the admin console and copy guild members' character names to the GPQ Image OCR app
- Screenshot the GPQ scores as referenced below (Win + Shift + S) and copy paste it to the GPQ Image OCR app. The OCR runs immediately after you paste the image.
